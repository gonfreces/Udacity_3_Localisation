# Udacity_3_Localisation

![Output](https://github.com/gonfreces/Udacity_3_Localisation_EKF/blob/master/EKF_robot.gif)

### Aim

- Learn basic features of **Localisation** 
- Learn to localize a robot using its pose estimates
- Learn to create **1D and 2D Kalman filter** using the error variance of the sensors
- Learn to create **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** and apply to remove from noise from a non-linear distribution measurement
- Learn to implement the **EKF package** in ROS
- Learn to create **Monte Carlo / Particle filter algorithm**

### Description

- Code snippets for 1D and 2D Kalman filter with different codes to for each step

### Installation

- I am assuming you already have Gazebo and ROS installed and running up.
- If not, refer to the readme files of the Gazebo world and Chase the ball repositories
- Moving on, install the EKF ROS package:
  1. Execute in source file of your catkin workspace: `git clone https://github.com/udacity/robot_pose_ekf`

### Launch

- Clone the repository onto to your device 
- Execute the codes individually and change the input values inside the code
